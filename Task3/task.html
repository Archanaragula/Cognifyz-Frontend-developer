            Oceans are vast bodies of saline water that cover about 71% of Earth's surface, playing a critical role in sustaining life and regulating the planet's climate.There are five major oceans: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic.
            They are interconnected and form a single global ocean, which is crucial for weather patterns, global temperature regulation, and the carbon cycle.Oceans are home to a diverse range of marine life, from microscopic plankton to the largest mammals, such as whales.
            They provide essential resources, including food, oxygen, and minerals, and support livelihoods through fishing, tourism, and transportation. Oceans also play a key role in the global economy and are vital for international trade.Despite their importance, oceans face significant threats from human activities, including pollution, overfishing, and climate change. These issues lead to habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and alterations in ocean chemistry, such as acidification.
            Conservation efforts are essential to protect and preserve ocean health for future generations. Sustainable practices, marine protected areas, and international cooperation are some of the measures needed to address these challenges.
